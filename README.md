# Procure Inc Analyzer

This is an old little  script/tool I coded up many years ago. It's purpose was to  connect to the Parsehub webcrawler, fetch crawling data, take in a pricing sheet provided by the user, and then generate an excel sheet, complete with conditional formatting.

This approach saved a ton of time and allowed for a far more nuanced approach to pricing. The work done here would take hours to do by hand, but here took minutes.
